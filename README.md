1.	The code defines three classes: LINES, MENU, and EMPLOYEE.
2.	The LINES class contains functions for drawing horizontal and vertical lines, creating boxes on the screen, and clearing the screen.
3.	The MENU class handles the main menu and edit menu for the payroll management system.
4.	The EMPLOYEE class includes functions for adding new employee records, modifying records, deleting records, displaying employee details, listing all employees, and generating salary slips.
5.	The program has a main menu that allows users to perform various actions, including adding new employees, displaying employee details, listing employees, generating salary slips, and editing employee records.
6.	The code uses file operations to read and write employee data to a file called "EMPLOYEE.DAT."
7.	Employee details include fields like name, address, phone number, date of joining, designation, grade, house allowance, conveyance allowance, loan amount, and basic salary.
8.	The program also performs input validation, ensuring that the user enters valid data.

The classes work together to implement the functionality of a Payroll Management System. The `LINES` class helps with graphical elements, the `MENU` class manages navigation, and the `EMPLOYEE` class handles employee-related operations and data management.

In essence, the employee payroll system adheres to object-oriented programming principles by defining a class (EMPLOYEE) and using objects of that class to manage employee records. This approach promotes code organization, encapsulation, and reusability, making it a practical way to model and interact with employee data in a structured manner.
